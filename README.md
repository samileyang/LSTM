# LSTM
using LSTM to predict the temperature in the future

The dataset I used is from NASA.The data they give include the temperature from 800,000 years ago, even earlier. In my opinion, the temperature from 1880-2015 will be perfect.

Indeed, there are some imperfection in this code. My friend uses tensorboard which is a great tool to visualize the data, including LOSS, prediction data, estimated data, etc.. I also heard that it is easy to conduct but the code should be added in sess, but in short term I don't have time to go deep into it.

Tips:
If you improve the value of steps, the accuracy will be better. However it is hard to evaluate because all this numbers is hard to dig out in short term.
